Hi!

If you've found this repository from the internet, it probably won't be helpful to you. I can't stop you from using code from here, however it is of variable quality (some intentionally, some probably not) so you do so at your own risk.
In addition to this, some of the code is pulled from the internet because I don't really know about or understand the PIO, so it may have other restrictions on it.

If you've found this repository from my course, then you still likely don't need to be here (since direct downloads are provided), however feel free to take a look at the other stuff I've made.
